# SNMP
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to accept MIB files, readable/writeable OIDs in MIB, perfrom a SNMP GET/SET function, and able to receive complete TRAP message(s) with a GUI.

Java isn't my main language, this is for a class project and am told to use Java. There might be some cringey code, and for that I am sorry.

Make sure the org/snmp4j file is in the same file as the snmpPanel.java and snmpViewer.java..... you have been warned
